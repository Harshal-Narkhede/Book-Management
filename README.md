# Book-Management
The Book Management Project is a Java-based web application designed to streamline the management of a bookstore's inventory. Developed using Spring Boot and MySQL database, the system offers essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficient book management.

Users can easily add new books by providing details such as name, author, pages, price, ISBN, description, and an associated book image. The system facilitates a user-friendly interface for viewing the complete book list, searching for specific books based on keywords, and accessing detailed information about each book.

An integral feature of the project is the ability to upload and associate images with each book, enhancing the visual representation of the inventory. Thymeleaf serves as the templating engine, ensuring dynamic content rendering on the front end.

Challenges faced during development include effective file handling for secure and optimal image uploads, seamless integration of MySQL with Spring Data JPA, and the design of an intuitive user interface for an enhanced user experience.
